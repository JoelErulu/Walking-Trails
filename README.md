### Description

The Walking Trails App is a mobile application designed to enhance the walking experience on Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) trails through interactive and educational content focused on fitness, health, and wellness. The app is accessible via QR codes placed on signs along the trails. By scanning a QR code, users are directed to the app, where they can access instructional videos, trail maps, exercise guides, and nutrition information, among other features. On the App users currently have the ability to register, sign in, edit their profiles, and view the different trails and videos. We are currently  implementing user feedback options for videos (like/dislike), collection of user statistics, and administrator functionalities regarding media management, as well as video retrieval based on category/subcategory.

### Technologies

- MongoDB

- Express

- Node
  https://nodejs.org/en/
- React
  https://reactjs.org/
- Google Maps API
- https://developers.google.com/maps
- (IMPORTANT)
- The Google Maps API needs key access from Google through paid access.
  Either a renewal of a access is needed or use a new Google account to obtain another key through free trial for the map to work.

### List of working features

1. Authentication - Create an account, store credentials in Mongoose, and access user-specific data. Log in to existing accounts.
2. Interactive Map - markers that contain content
3. Admin view - Admin can assign privleges, create content, update content, delete content.
4. Video retrieval - Users can access videos is stored on MongoDB attached to map markers

### Features our team developed

1. User Registration & Authentication: This feature was broken when we first accessed the project. We re-implemented it, and changed the schema to accomodate for new requirements, and tested it to ensure functionality.
2. Custom navbar that generate based on user role. We wanted to lock certain pages so they could only be accessed by users who are signed in, and also for security purposes.
3. Role-based access for all pages. This is great for security, as we wouldn't want non-signed in users to access content they shouldn't be able to see.
4. All new site map. We heavily modified the landing page, and kept only the trails pages from the previous group, with modified UI design.
5. The previous groups had developed video upload and retrieval for markers on the trail maps. However, our new requirements required video galleries and not map-marker based videos. We kept their previous groups work, and implemented our solution in parallel on new pages using embedded links & Google Drive for right now for proof of concept.

### Features in progress

- Password reset through email
- Ability to add/like videos & track views
- Ability to edit user profile information
- Ability to upgrade/downgrade a user's role from administrator portal
- Ability to upload & delete embedded videos to DB
